    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape.
    Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.
    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
    Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian cuisine, and are often found in French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern
    croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
    yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked
    dough made them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La
    Croissanterie chain, was a French response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30-40% of the croissants sold
    in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
